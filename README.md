## Description

Eat the Burger is objectively the most delicious app on the web (according to burger experts, but mostly myself). These days, burgers come in all shapes and sizes. Most have lettece or cheese, but few are made out of pixels. Eat the Burger provides the user with an immersive, interactive experience where they can create their own custom burger and devour it!

*Fun Fact! The total amount of burgers eaten is cumulative with other users. You may see burgers that others have eaten in the Ready-to-Eat tray or Burgers Eaten tray.*
